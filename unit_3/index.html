		<h4>With 209,000 cybersecurity vacancies and only 65,000 CISSPs, the U.S. cybersecurity job market is broken.</h4>
		<p>The few Information Security (InfoSec) professionals employed by enterprise are overwhelmed and often miss intrusion events, leading to devastating hacks like those at OPM, Target, and Sony.</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Automation isn't enough.</h4>
		<p>Existing security solutions cannot be implemented in a timely manner without competent Sales Engineers on the vendor side and InfoSec professionals on the customer side.</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Stealth Worker's flexible workforce is the solution</h4>

		<ul>
			<li>Highly skilled specialists with flexible work hours supplement their income working on challenging projects</li>
			<li>Businesses select from premium candidates, paying for hours contracted rather than a highly padded, 40-hours per week per worker</li>
			<li>Stealth Worker makes the connection, providing a truly flexible workforce in days rather than the 22-28 weeks per candidate common in large enterprises</li>
		</ul>
